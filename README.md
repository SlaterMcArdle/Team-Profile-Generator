  ## Description
  The project goal was to create an interactive command line application to build a team web page. 
  There are three member roles:
    - Manager
    - Engineer
    - Intern
  Each of them have common attributes falling under the Employee category.
    - name
    - Id
    - email
  Each category also has an attribute specific to them.
    - Manager - office number
    - Engineer - github
    - Intern - school

  The input starts by adding a manager. After that the user can add as many different employees as they wish.
  WHen they're done, the team html page gets generated.
